    <h1>Interneting is Easy! </h1>
    <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <h2>Headings </h2>
    <p> Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings </p>

    <h2> Lists </h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Add a "ul" list element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li> Add each item in its own "li" element </li>
      <li> Thye don't need to be in any particular order </li>
    </ul>

    <p> This is what an ordered list looks like: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything </li>
      <li> But, also the list item elements are the same </li>
      <li> You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Inline Elements </h2>
    <p><em> Sometimes </em> , you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase </p>
    <p> Other times you need to <strong> strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase </p>
    <p><em><strong> And sometimes you need to shout! </strong></em></p>
